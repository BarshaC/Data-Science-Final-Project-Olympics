    "The objective of this project is to examine trends in athlete ages, sex, and physical attributes (e.g., height and weight) across 120 years of Olympic history. This includes investigating how the number of participating countries has increased over time and analyzing the rise of female participation, particularly as female categories of sports were introduced—something that was not prevalent in the early 1920s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the project aims to explore the representation of smaller countries, examining their ability to win medals compared to historically dominant nations. Lastly, the analysis seeks to understand age diversity by studying how participants span across different age groups."

    "The data can be interpreted in different ways. I aim to understand the trends of the Olympics over the 120 years. I started with understanding the data by going through the different columns for what data can be used to understand the trend. The data had good percentage of missing values for columns like Age, Weight, Height and Medals. These were important columns needed to understand the demographic trends and also to understand what are the top teams with most wins. So, I had to clean up the data for visualization and analysis. "
